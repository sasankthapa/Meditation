# Meditation

This is just a fun project I wanted to do try out. Learned about the limits of css and javascript.

Issue: you can't do multiple clicks and hold... that will have a lot of set timeouts which will cause the page to behave weird.

[x] Add Event listener to the body to listen to mouse clicks.
[x] Add the image of the guy meditating in the middle.
[x] Create an animation of the guy using transform.
[x] Add an transparent circle over the guy
